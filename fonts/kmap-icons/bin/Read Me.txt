Build font set with online service app at www.icomoon.io

You can import *selection.json* back to the IcoMoon app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu > Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.

You also can import the existing SVG files directly, and add new ones from other libraries on the website icomoon, or make new custom ones.
